# How to deal with an unresponsive SME*?
(*SME: Subject Matter Expert)

**Find out about SME as much as possible** 

People like to talk but from the whole bunch of information there *must* be something nice that you could use. Go around the office for some talk with the team members, look at SME’s social media profile or even search the Internet. As they say: if somebody does not exist in the Internet, he does not exist at all. Perhaps he is a:
- traveller and chocolate fan? 
- Does he have a pet? 
- Does he like helping at some local community? 
It is good to have an elevator pitch when you “accidentally” meet him or her in the office corridor. Even if you have to wait for this lift for an hour! In case of home office work you may snip some private information in an email or via an official chat like Slack (work communicator). At last, you are together and it is time for you to start a conversation. Do not hurry into official talk but start with private matters. It would be good to mention some private problem that is of SME’s interest. People like to give advice! And even more, they are keen on people with the same hobbies. Do not forget to  show admiration and delight at SME’s opinion or solutions. There is very little time so ask the SME for dinner to continue your conversation. Once you will find yourself in some circle of SME’s attention it will be much easier for you to switch smoothly to professional matters. 

**Make a deep dive into the subject**
A person that is *always* in a hurry hates when their time is wasted so remember to be well-prepared for the topic. Try to set a meeting. Most probably you will see each team member’s Outlook calendar. 
- Approach  the SME directly so as to propose two or three different meeting dates. It will show that you value SME’s time. 
- Then go quickly into your computer and set a meeting in their electronic calendar. Even if they do not accept the meeting, the alert a few minutes ahead of time will show up on their computers. 
- Bring a recorder and a list of relevant questions, however, make sure that the interview is not only in a question-answer mode.  Think of it more as an opportunity to discuss the product so do make sure that information you are looking for cannot be find easily. You may have only one chance to carry out such a meeting. 
- Clarify what you find unclear or misunderstood, ask for some  drafts, pictures or  illustration.  
- At the end of the interview find out if there is any chance to meet again in some time ahead for possible further questions. Or perhaps an SME will have a chance to read your work? It is always better to know what you can expect. If you feel positive SME’s attitude ask for a possible time limit as people are much more likely to respond to what is set (for example: “Please let me know the best time for you next week”). 

However, let’s imagine that your try outs did not come out the way you planned. What is next? 

1.  **Attend each team’s meeting.** It is not only a perfect way to find out what is going on within the project but also what is going on in your team’s private matters. Maybe you will have a chance to find out about some after-hours meeting and join it? When you know your team (and your SME) the work goes easier. Or some team member is a friend of SME and may say a few good words about you. 
2. **Offer your expertise.** How about offering your help in a different field?  Checking a report or language correction of their presentation may be a good solution to be remembered. Offering help shows your openness and understanding of someone’s job and gives you the chance to be return a favor.
3. **Write reminders.** When writing an email use "first request", "second request", "third request" but remain polite and professional. 
**Escalate the problem to SME’s boss.** Check if you have the same boss. Print emails and invitation proposals and have a meeting with SME’s manager. However, this path may be not that nice. Nevertheless, still stay polite. 
4. **Write anything.**  Try to write a draft of your work the way you understand it. Do not worry if it is stupid or inadequate. Once you send it for correction there may be a lot of revisors. It is a bit risky so be careful with that method! 
   
Have in mind that you need to be flexible and match the situation to the method. It is not good to escalate the problem to your supervisors as you are part of the team so spoiling the work atmosphere may not be a good solution. Everyone likes his job be done so just try to meet for an honest talk about achieving the project’s main goal.
